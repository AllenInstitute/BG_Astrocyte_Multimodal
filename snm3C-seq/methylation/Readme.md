# Clustering and annotations for snm3C-seq cells
## 1. precluster
- Correct for batch effect
- Preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Jointly embedding

## 2. Consensus clustering
- Consensus clustering
- Calculate hypo-score for each cell type using the top marker genes from sc-RNA-seq
- Visualize hypomethylation of marker genes

## 3. Cell Type annotations
- Assign cell tyep labels
